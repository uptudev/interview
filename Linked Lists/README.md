# Linked Lists

This folder contains all interview questions having to do with linked lists.

The current questions in the crate are listed below in alphabetical order:

|Name|Prompt|
|---|---|
|add_two_numbers|You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.|
|linked_list_palindrome|Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return `true` if it is a palindrome or `false` otherwise.|
|rev_linked_list|Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.|
