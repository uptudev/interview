## How to Contribute

Contributions to this repository are welcomed and encouraged, however I would like to try to figure out all of the questions I plan to add on my own, so please only contribute via changes to functions I've already written. If you would like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a branch for your changes
3. Make your changes
4. Open a pull request

When making your changes, please ensure that your code follows Rust best practices and conventions. Additionally, please update the appropriate README file with the question and answer that you have changed. If you *really* have a particular question in mind which I haven't gotten around to yet, shoot me a message on GitHub and I'll put it at the top of my queue.
